### TL;DR
I like creating things.

### Who am I?
[I'm Brian and so's my wife.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SYc_flMnMQ)

But seriously, my name is Ryan and recently, I moved from Galway in sunny Ireland to London. I always feel really weird writing about myself so I'm going to keep this brief. I like creating things. More specifically, I like creating things on computers.

Currently trying to find my niche in the programming world. A love for clever algorithms and a growing love for Python, despite it's lack of support for encapsulation, are starting to shape my path. Always interested in learning and experimenting with emerging technologies. That's it really. Like I said, it feels weird writing this and I'm keeping it brief. Feel free to contact me through the platform of your choice!
